# SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic_Spans_Detection

### SemEval
[SemEval](https://semeval.github.io/) is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared. SemEval is sponsored by the SIGLEX Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics. \

### Toxic Span Detection

The Toxic Spans Detection task concerns the evaluation of systems that detect the spans that make a text toxic, when detecting such spans is possible. Moderation is crucial to promoting healthy online discussions. Although several toxicity (a.k.a. abusive language) detection datasets (Wulczyn et al., 2017; Borkan et al., 2019) and models (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017; Pavlopoulos et al., 2017b; Zampieri et al., 2019) have been released, most of them classify whole comments or documents, and do not identify the spans that make a text toxic. But highlighting such toxic spans can assist human moderators (e.g., news portals moderators) who often deal with lengthy comments, and who prefer attribution instead of just a system-generated unexplained toxicity score per post. The evaluation of systems that could accurately locate toxic spans within a text is thus a crucial step towards successful semi-automated moderation. \
